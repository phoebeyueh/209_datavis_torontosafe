                    <p>We are a dedicated group of 4 students from UC Berkeley, driven by the mission to empower tourists and newcomers to Toronto with comprehensive safety information.</p>
                    <p>Our project is centered around creating a dashboard that serves for those seeking to familiarize themselves with the city, with a particular interest in understanding the safety landscape.
                        This features detailed insights into recent safety trends, comparison of different neighbourhoods, and interactive map visualizations.
                        Beyond safety, we recognize the importance of experiencing the city to its fullest with inclusion of key tourist attractions.</p>
                    <p>Our goal is to offer additional, helpful information that ensures a safe and enjoyable stay for all visitors and new residents of Toronto.‚Äù</p>
