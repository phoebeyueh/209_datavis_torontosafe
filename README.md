## 👩‍🎓 About 
I completed this project as part of the Data Visualization class at UC Berkeley alongside my peers Abraham Yang, Elena Xie, and Leo Le. I want to express my gratitude for their valuable contributions to the project!

## 💻 Introduction
The project aims to develop a website called TorontoSafe, providing an interactive overview of crime statistics. Utilizing Tableau, HTML and CSS, the dashboard will feature a dynamic map showcasing crime frequency and severity, alongside tables highlighting recent crime metrics and top neighborhoods for common crimes. With a user-friendly design inspired by a tour guide theme, the dashboard offers visitors a comprehensive yet accessible tool to navigate crime data and enhance their safety and enjoyment in the city.
